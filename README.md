# Motion-Path
Motion Path is a feature that creates a Bézier curved line along which an object animates. Integrated into our motion-design-centric apps, it allows end users to configure custom curves by simply dragging an unlimited number of control points. This open-source project is crucial for advancing AI in motion design—by defining bespoke trajectories, we can instruct AI to animate UI elements along precisely tailored paths for explainer videos and customer education content. Currently, producing an explainer video in tools like After Effects can cost over $4,000 and take weeks; our approach paves the way for an Adobe After Effects alternative in the browser, similar to how Canva revolutionized Photoshop. Motion Path is just one major pillar of our broader vision, with additional features needed to complete a comprehensive toolset for professional-grade motion design.
